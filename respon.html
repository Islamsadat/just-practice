                A car is a vehicle that has wheels, carries a small number
                 of passengers, and is moved by an engine or a motor. Cars 
                 are also called automobiles or motor vehicles. Trucks and buses are motor
                 vehicles as well. However, trucks and buses are larger than cars, and they carry heavier loads.</p>
